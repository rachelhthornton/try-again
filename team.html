                    	I'll be your math expert! I've been a private tutor for levels 6-12 and college students for 5 years, starting work while completing my BS in Mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin and continuing work through and beyond my time earning a Master's from Lehigh University. I have two years additional experience as a teaching assistant at Lehigh for multiple different undergraduate Calculus courses. This means I'm an experienced educator, I know what your professors are looking for, the common mistakes students make and the exam content that they'll forget to study. I also eat Calculus for breakfast!

                    	I am a dedicated and seasoned classroom teacher with nearly a decade in education experience. I have worked in classrooms all over the U.S., specializing primarily in middle school and high school Science. I graduated from Virginia Tech with a Bachelor’s degree in Biological Sciences in 2017, and more recently graduated from Teacher’s College at Columbia University with a Master’s degree in Curriculum and Teaching in 2023. I have extensive curriculum and pedagogy experience spread over all age groups and subjects and take great pleasure in helping others to reach their goals. In my free time, I like to run, read, and cook.
